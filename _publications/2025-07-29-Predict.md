title: "Predicting Maintenance Cessation of Open Source Software Repositories with An Integrated Feature Framework"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-07-29-Predict
excerpt: 'Open source software (OSS) maintenance risks threaten software quality and security, but existing prediction methods struggle with unclear definitions and limited interpretability. We introduce a clear definition of “maintenance cessation” and create a large-scale dataset of 115,466 GitHub repositories to study it. By designing a multi-perspective feature framework, our survival analysis achieves high accuracy (C-index 0.846) and strong interpretability, outperforming traditional models. We validate real-world application by screening risks in the openEuler ecosystem, providing a scalable and interpretable approach to OSS maintenance risk prediction.'
