title: "Enhancing the Performance of Next-Generation SSD Arrays: A Holistic Approach"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-04-30-ScalaAFA
excerpt: 'All-flash arrays (AFAs) face software overheads that limit the performance of next-generation SSDs. We present ScalaAFA, a user-space AFA engine that reduces these overheads by offloading internal tasks to SSDs and using efficient inter-thread synchronization. With novel data placement and careful exploitation of SSD features, ScalaAFA achieves up to 2.5Ã— higher write throughput and 52.7% lower write latency than state-of-the-art approaches.'
